# Secret for Emma API Credentials
# 
# Before deploying the Emma CSI Driver, you must create this secret with your Emma.ms API credentials.
# 
# To obtain credentials:
# 1. Log in to your Emma.ms account at https://portal.emma.ms
# 2. Navigate to Settings > Service Applications
# 3. Create a new Service Application with "Manage" access level
# 4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
# 
# To create the secret, replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with your actual credentials:
#
#   kubectl create secret generic emma-api-credentials \
#     --from-literal=client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
#     --from-literal=client-secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
#     --namespace=kube-system
#
# Or apply this file after replacing the placeholder values:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: emma-api-credentials
  namespace: kube-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # Replace with your Emma.ms Service Application Client ID
  client-id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
  
  # Replace with your Emma.ms Service Application Client Secret
  client-secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# - Never commit this file with real credentials to version control
# - Use a secret management solution (e.g., Sealed Secrets, External Secrets Operator) in production
# - Ensure the Service Application has only "Manage" access level (principle of least privilege)
# - Rotate credentials regularly
# - The CSI driver will automatically refresh access tokens using these credentials
